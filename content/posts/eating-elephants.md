Sometimes I forget things that are *obviously* true.

Like the fact that there are only so many days in a lifetime, and only so many minutes in a day.  
Or that the people I admire worked insanely hard to achieve what they did, and so must I.  

These are the **invariants**.

When the journey is long and uncomfortable,  
I procrastinate in inventive and subtle ways.  
But neither squirming nor wishful thinking  
    changes anything;  
the invariants are indifferent.

The elephant is an elephant is an elephant,  
and I must do what I know I must.
