In [Cipher](https://bencolewu.itch.io/cipher) you solve a series of abstract puzzles while figuring out the rules. It's probably inspired by [The Witness](http://the-witness.net/)?

As you progress through the levels, the game introduces surprising concepts while maintaining a small ruleset. It achieves this by first showing narrower applications of rules, before revealing the more general cases. For example, dots are always placed outside of the 1x1 squares in earlier levels, but subsequently they can appear outside. And eventually, those 1x1 squares were generalized to rectangles and other compound shapes. This reminds me of the [2-4-6 task](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rmAbiEKQDpDnZzcRf/positive-bias-look-into-the-dark) which demonstrates confirmation bias.

Often when introduced to a concept, you will solve the level without understanding why. Being able to scroll back and study previous levels in their solved states is very useful for deducing the rules. Not all puzzle games can do this though; I think the end states needs to somehow contain their initial states.

Solving the larger levels tend to feel tedious, and overall I think the possibility space wasn't that interesting. But maybe there are more surprises to be revealed?
