There have been many definitions of games, yet not that many about game design.

Definitions are useful for communication. Also for trying to understand something?

"Experience" is too broad? All art forms provide an experience.

Game design is the ___ crafting of possibility spaces, the tools for a player to explore/mutate, and systems which potentially mutate the space.
mutations? aren't those just built into the possiblity space?
