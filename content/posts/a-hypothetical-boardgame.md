Imagine a boardgame, in which you can play solo, cooperatively, or competitively. The goal is to get as many victory points as possible.

You start with some amount of resources.
Each turn, you get a certain number of action points, which you can spend to help you earn victory points.
There is also an upkeep phase, where there's an amount of resources which you have to pay each turn.

What's your strategy?

What do you assign victory points to?

How best to deal with upkeep?
Do you try and reduce the amount of upkeep you have to pay?
Spend action points to gain more resources?
Passive income?
Invest for long term reward?
- risk/reward
- opportunity costs





Design an actual boardgame for this? Or digital game?
Goals are cards that you can draft?
- there are certain things you can do to advance more quickly
  - not always clear cut? e.g. going to college
- spend points to advance them?

Switch goals halfway?
It's not about the easiest goal. 
Some victories are hollow.
Some are worth pursuing even if they are hard.

These are fun questions to think about. And strategy is kind of opaque?
