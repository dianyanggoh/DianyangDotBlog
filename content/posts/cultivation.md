Here's a section from the Mind Illuminated, a book on meditation:

*During meditation, however, if you return to the breath as soon as you realize you've lost it, you'll miss a key opportunity for training the mind.*

*The way to overcome mind-wandering is by training this unconcious process to make the discovery and bring it into consciousness sooner and more often. Yet how do you train something that happens unconsciously? Simply take a moment to enjoy and appreciate "waking up" from mind wandering. Savor the sense of being morefully conscious and present. Cherish your epihany and enocurage yourself to have more of them. Conscious intention and affirmation powerfully influence our unconscious processes.*

Maybe you can't force love, but maybe you can cultivate it.

I like the word cultivation. Long-term, patient. For good. Investment. delayed gratification.



Meditation. Intention.

Perhaps this could be a series of posts on ideas for cultivating specific things.
Cultivating playfulness.
Cultivating kindness.
Cultivating creativity.

The "Cultivation series" kinda has a nice ring to it. Like the Culture series + Foundation series?
