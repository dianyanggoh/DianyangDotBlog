[Rupert Reset](https://havana24.itch.io/rupert-reset) is a puzzle platformer made for a game jam, where you can reset certain objects in each level to their original state. It's very similar to Braid, in which only glowing items are immune to time manipulation. The art is very polished and cute; the "snow-bear" main character is quite unique!

There were a few interesting applications of the mechanics, though I felt like the spikes were mostly just unnecessary distractions. 

I'd like to practice thinking about how I might improve or expand on some of these games I try. For starters, there's room to explore interactions between existing elements(e.g. buttons/enemies/gates on pushable blocks, resetable gates/buttons, etc). Maybe different color-coded reset buttons and resettable objects? I think allowing players to affect items' resettability will change up the game significantly.

I'm not sure if these will just be cute gimmicks, or if the sum of parts will have something meaningful to say. More than just its core mechanic, what is the game really *about*?
