I played [Tiny Islands](https://dr-d-king.itch.io/tiny-islands) a while back and very much preferred it over  [Islanders](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046030/ISLANDERS/), mainly because the grid makes things much clearer. Both games are quite relaxing, and have great aesthetics.

I don't really enjoy such games though, as the min-maxing involved usually feels too much like work. It was fascinating to hear the [developer talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXAcWMVzHfE) about designing the scoring system around what looked visually appealing to him. I guess scoring systems for these games tend to be fairly arbitrary anyway, so you might as well try to steer players toward something beautiful?

I think it'd be an interesting challenge to design something more toy-like, *without* a scoring system. It seems to me that while young children can be endlessly entertained by a single toy, we tend to need explicit goals to hold our attention as we grow older.

Are there other ways to increase the longevity of toys?  
Are there ways to encourage the rekindling our child-like playfulness?
