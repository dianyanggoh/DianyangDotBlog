Finally got around to playing [Helltaker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1289310/Helltaker/). It's short and sweet and I had a great time with it.

After solving each puzzle level, you're presented with a short dialogue and two dialogue choices. If you pick the wrong choice, you have to redo the entire level! The choices tend to be nonsensical, and picking the right choice is essentially a coin toss.

This seems like *obviously* terrible design, but I found that it forced me to actually read the text in trying to make an educated guess. Making the wrong choice isn't actually that bad since the levels are short, but getting it right on the first attempt feels disproportionately satisfying.


**SPOILER BELOW!**  
The boss fight kept the arrow key controls, but abandoned the turn-based puzzles for a punishing twitch-based challenge. Again, it seems "obviously" wrong to require sharp reflexes from players for a game that's been presented thus far as a turn-based puzzle game!

It's quite inspiring to see developers pushing against design norms. In this case, the result is a game that feels wild and refreshing. 

We expect games to fair, and it's interesting to think about how far we can against that. At the time of writing this, the game has almost 20k reviews and they're "Overwhelmingly Positive."
