Science is evidence-based but most of us don't witness the evidence first-hand. We neither perform the experiments nor observe the results. 
Instead, we put our faith in scientists to verify each other's works. (Faith can be [misplaced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis).)

In that sense, ours is a kind of pseudo-science.

There is another kind of faith in science. We assume that if every time we've dropped a ball it's been observed to fall, it will likely continue to do so for future attempts.

Where does that leave us?
