I Love Hue Too is a simple mobile puzzle game about rearranging colors according to their hues.

I played mostly by intuition and had a relaxing, pleasurable experience. (You're shown the fewest possible number of moves though, and the world average, if you want more challenge.) 

I wonder if the game trains you to better discern hues. Probably?

The levels are satisfying to complete in a way that's subtly different from most other puzzle games. I think there's something about restoring order to chaos which our human pysche finds deeply pleasurable, like in Tetris. I'd like to eventually compile a list of categories of tasks which seem to innately appeal to us.

I was also intrigued by how the colors were tiled together in many different geometric combinations. [Monument Valley](https://www.ustwogames.co.uk/games/monument-valley/) explored Escher's [impossible objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_object), but maybe there's a game in exploring his [tessellations](http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMT668/EMAT6680.2002.Fall/AllenL/MATH%207200/Escher%20Project/Tessellations&Escher/Tessellations&Escher.html).

While not the most original or deep idea, it's well-executed with its minimalistic UI, and wallpaper-ready screens.
