I bought Lost Cities on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lost-cities/id465062454) after hearing about it on [The Spelunky Showlike](http://thespelunkyshowlike.libsyn.com/44-quarantine-arcade-with-derek-yu) podcast. It's the digital adaptation of the original board game by 
[Reiner Knizia](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/2/reiner-knizia).

It's inspiring how much depth is packed into such simple rules. New strategies occur to me as I play, and it's not always clear if I'm making the best move. I'm still working my way through the AI opponents, but I'm looking forward to playing against other online players. I suspect playing against real players will be quite a different experience!

While the app feels a bit dated, I really like the UI. Portrait mode is great, and the way your hand of cards is laid out is quite clever. I like the option to either drag the cards or to tap. The digital version also handles all the points bookkeeping, which is great.

According to Screen Time in iOS, I've played it for 4 hours 46 minutes this week!
