What if there's a training program that, when followed religiously, will very likely make you world-class in your chosen craft?
I don't know of any such program for game design, so I'd like to design one.

[Tyler Cowen asks](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/07/learn-like-an-athlete-knowledge-workers-should-train.html):

*"What is it you do to train that is comparable to a pianist practicing scales?"*
(He gives his personal answer in a [later post](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/07/how-i-practice-at-what-i-do.html).)

What are the key features of practicing scales that are relevant here? 
- Deepen mastery over fundamentals
  - Repeatable but with variation
    - Simplicity


Ideas
- play a classic game. re-implement it with one design tweak.
  - too much work?
- identify atoms, fundamentals.
  - design a game
- design a game every day
  - playtest?
- identify a problem in a game. come up with solutions.
  - no feedback?
- ability to iterate?

Remaining Questions:
- Practicing scales alone certainly won't make you world-class. What other important activities are there? What's the game designer's version of *those* activities?
- Is it possible that these practices may not map well from one domain to another?
- What other areas can I apply these techniques to?
- Are there metrics to track?
- What are the signs that I need to course correct?
- Are there options I'm not considering?
