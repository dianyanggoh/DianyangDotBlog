Why explore storytelling in games?

Games are about exploration of possibility spaces.
We want to find meaning in life, in books, film, etc. What is this about?
Stories aren't the only way to give meaning?



In the ideal case, every exploration of the possiblity space feels unique?


darkest dungeon
ftl
rimworld
pax pamir
oath
streets of rogue?



why don't we imagine narratives for chess?
