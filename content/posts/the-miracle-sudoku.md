This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKf9aUIxdb4) of someone solving a sudoku variant went viral recently. I wasn't nearly as impressed, but you can really see his sense of awe as he progressed through the puzzle. 

There are probably a few varieties of awe. In this case, I think it came from this sense that something should be impossible but somehow isn't. I think elegance, when something is ridiculous . 

It seems like awe is discovered? Programmers like to talk about how Lisp was discovered, not invented. (http://www.paulgraham.com/lispfaq1.html)
Awe, whether through discovery or invention, seems like a worthy thing to strive for, in both the arts and sciences.
