This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKf9aUIxdb4) of an expert solving a sudoku variant went viral recently. Personally the most striking thing was his sense of **awe** as he progressed through the puzzle. 

There are probably a few varieties of awe. Like in this case, I think it comes from a sense that something should be impossible but somehow isn't. Another flavor of awe seems closely related to elegance, 

It seems like awe is discovered? Programmers like to talk about how Lisp was [discovered, not invented](http://www.paulgraham.com/lispfaq1.html).
Awe, whether through discovery or invention, seems like a worthy thing to strive for, in both the arts and sciences.
