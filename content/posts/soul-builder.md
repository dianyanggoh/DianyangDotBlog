[Soul Builder](https://rose11.itch.io/soul-builder) is a short "idle" game with worker placement mechanics.

You have to sacrifice workers to construct certain buildings. There's no real choice involved because the construction of these buildings constitute the winning condition. The optimal time to sacrifice workers is obvious, but efficiency doesn't matter much since you will accumulate enough resources eventually. 

Maybe the game is trying to encourage you to question the morality of sacrificing these workers, but I don't think that was the intention.

You do have to manually move resources around, which is a drag. I think the setup lends itself well to automating the piping of outputs to inputs, like in Factorio.
