>*"Our external, visible bodily life is similar to scaffolding supporting a building. The scaffolding itself is only necessary while the building is under construction. When the building is finished the scaffolding is no longer necessary and can be removed. It is the same with our bodily life. **The body is only there to support the construction of our spiritual life, and as soon as that has been completed, the body can disappear.**"*  
â€” Tolstoy

That death is natural is not an original idea, but I find this particular framing strangely comforting. I suspect the simple truth in its logic appeals to my work ethic. We each have a function to perform, and a job well done brings deep satisfaction even for the most menial of tasks. Personally, I'm indifferent to the constructed building as legacy.


It's fascinating to me that a core idea, expressed *slightly* differently, can be so dramatically more persuasive. And because the resulting conviction is often powerful, it seems valuable to experimentally mutate our perspectives for the potential discovery of something game-changing.
