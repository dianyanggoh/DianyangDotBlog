I came across a post titled [Human Programming Interface](https://beepb00p.xyz/hpi.html) recently.

Imagine being able to program your own behavior and emotions. We may be able to [do literally that](https://www.neuralink.com/) one day, but until then a will-powered, self-enforced prototype will have to suffice. What if you exhaustively defined a set of rules detailing how you should behave in every conceivable scenario, and then committed to it? That would be *transformative*.

That's what I thought the post would be about, but it was about something else entirely. (It's an interesting read nonetheless!) It felt weirdly magical, like I had found a free idea where there shouldn't have been one. 

It made me realize that I have a soft spot for writing vague titles, despite valuing succinct communciation. Trying to figure out the subject of a post, based on its title and tags, is like this unlikely little game in itself. Bonus points if the actual content surprises you!
