      <description>Rupert Reset is a puzzle platformer made for a game jam, where you can reset certain objects in each level to their original state. It&amp;rsquo;s very similar to Braid, in which only glowing items are immune to time manipulation. The art is very polished and cute; the &amp;ldquo;snow-bear&amp;rdquo; main character is quite unique!
There were a few interesting applications of the mechanics, though I felt like the spikes were mostly just unnecessary distractions.</description>
