      <description>&amp;ldquo;Our external, visible bodily life is similar to scaffolding supporting a building. The scaffolding itself is only necessary while the building is under construction. When the building is finished the scaffolding is no longer necessary and can be removed. It is the same with our bodily life. The body is only there to support the construction of our spiritual life, and as soon as that has been completed, the body can disappear.</description>
