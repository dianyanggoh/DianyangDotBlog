      <description>Soul Builder is a short &amp;ldquo;idle&amp;rdquo; game with worker placement mechanics.
You have to sacrifice workers to construct certain buildings. There&amp;rsquo;s no real choice involved because the construction of these buildings constitute the winning condition. The optimal time to sacrifice workers is obvious, but efficiency doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter much since you will accumulate enough resources eventually.
Maybe the game is trying to encourage you to question the morality of sacrificing these workers, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think that was the intention.</description>
