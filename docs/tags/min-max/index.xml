      <description>I played Tiny Islands a while back and very much preferred it over Islanders, mainly because the grid makes things much clearer. Both games are quite relaxing, and have great aesthetics.
I don&amp;rsquo;t really enjoy such games though, as the min-maxing involved usually feels too much like work. It was fascinating to hear the developer talk about designing the scoring system around what looked visually appealing to him. I guess scoring systems for these games tend to be fairly arbitrary anyway, so you might as well try to steer players toward something beautiful?</description>
