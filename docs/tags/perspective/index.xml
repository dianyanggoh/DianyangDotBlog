      <description>Groundhog Day&amp;lsquo;s premise seems curious, until you realize that most of us are living and reliving &amp;ldquo;Groundhog Weeks&amp;rdquo;.
But we are not &amp;ldquo;trapped&amp;rdquo; in a time loop.

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Our external, visible bodily life is similar to scaffolding supporting a building. The scaffolding itself is only necessary while the building is under construction. When the building is finished the scaffolding is no longer necessary and can be removed. It is the same with our bodily life. The body is only there to support the construction of our spiritual life, and as soon as that has been completed, the body can disappear.</description>

      <description>Q: How do you eat an elephant?
A: One bite at a time.
 Sometimes I forget things that are obviously true.
Like the fact that there are only so many days in a lifetime, and only so many minutes in a day.
Or that the people I admire worked insanely hard to achieve what they did, and so must I.
These are the invariants.
When the journey is long and uncomfortable,</description>
