      <description>I came across a post titled Human Programming Interface recently.
Imagine being able to program your own behavior and emotions. We may be able to do literally that one day, but until then a will-powered, self-enforced prototype will have to suffice. What if you exhaustively defined a set of rules detailing how you should behave in every conceivable scenario, and then committed to it? That would be transformative.
That&amp;rsquo;s what I thought the post would be about, but it was about something else entirely.</description>
