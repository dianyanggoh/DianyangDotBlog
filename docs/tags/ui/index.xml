I wonder if the game trains you to better discern hues. Probably?
The levels are satisfying to complete in a way that&amp;rsquo;s subtly different from most other puzzle games.</description>

When combat begins, an enemy target is selected by default. Players can switch target anytime, but otherwise the target remains the same each turn. This saves players an extra click most of the time when they perform an action, since the optimal strategy in most cases is to focus fire on one enemy anyway. (AOE actions hit all enemies instead of a subset of enemies, so targeting is skipped.</description>
